# bmm-g-code-syntax README

This is working draft of custom syntax for G-Code, for use on Visual Studion Code. Suggestions/improvements/criticisms are welcome and encrouraged as this is my first attempt at several things throughout this process.

## Features

This package is intended to highlight and color specific portions of your G-Code and specific ways. Generally speaking, it is intended to make important or often-searched parts of your G-Code very easy to find, and stand out amongst generic X/Y/Z moves. 

## Requirements

You must of VS code installed, obviously, and you will need to update your settings.json file in order to customize your colors. 

## Extension Settings


## Known Issues

## Release Notes
